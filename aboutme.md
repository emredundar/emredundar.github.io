I manage the software development environment **from one line** on IDE to software **product release**. 
Automation is the best friend of mine "continuously". I use scripts **as my tools, simple but effective**. I'm a fan of **code quality** and **continuous** things (*integration, delivery, deployment, testing, improvement, inspection...*).

- +3 years worked for **SoftTech/Isbank** as a **Software Configuration and DevOps Engineer** on SDLC Tools & DevOps Unit.
- Now working for **Ericsson R&D** as a **Deployment and Release Manager** on Product Development Unit.
