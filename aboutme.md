I manage the software development environment from ide to software deployment. 
Automation is the best friend of mine "continuously". 
I use scripts **as my tools, simple but effective**.

- +3 years worked for SoftTech/Isbank as Software Dev. Env. and DevOps Engineer.
- Now working for Ericsson R&D as Deployment and Release Manager.
