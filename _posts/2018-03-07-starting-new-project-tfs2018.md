After creating a new project on TFS, you need to start coding on this project.

There are 5 ways of starting a new project on TFS 2018. You can choose your action depending on your status of project.

1- You don't have any code written.
2- You have code on your local machine.
3- You have an existing git repository on your local machine.
4- You have an existing repository on a different Git repository.
5- You don't want to add any code repository, just need a build system.
