### **Introduction**
Git users know that gitignore files plays an important role to manage their source code repository. 

**gitignore files** helps developers to avoid sliding into chaos on their *complex coding environment*.

Ignoring the files below is a good practice to keep your source code repository cleaner:
* IDE configuration/cache files,
* User-specific files,
* Build output files, 
* Auto-generated files,
* Secret/config files,
* Data files,
* Environment-specific files,
* Test result files,
* Dependency packages...

In this post series, some good practices about creating effective gitignore files will be noted into the pages of my personal notepad.

You can find a collection of .gitignore templates on this repository: https://github.com/github/gitignore
